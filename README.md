# Newtons-Method-for-Polys
Recursively calculates the roots of a polynomial through using the algorithm described by the Newton-Raphson Method

*Important:
This is a java program. I have included a runnable jar file for you to test locally, but it will require a java environment to run.
To test, download and run the Newton's Method 4 Polys.jar
